Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack Developer from Tel Aviv. I actually fell head over heels for programming while working in the exciting world of tech at AffiliaXe and Outbrain. It was a game-changer, and I knew I had to dive deeper into development. 

Today, I'm fully devoted to Full-Stack Development, eagerly seeking exhilarating projects. 

âš¡ fun fact: I'm a total comic and manga nerd. I can't resist diving into the amazing stories and artwork. 
Plus, I'm a photography enthusiast, particularly when it comes to Argentique and Lomography cameras.

Let's connect and make some magic happen:
